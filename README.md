# Python Daily Projects

A collection of small Python projects I'm building to develop my programming skills.

## About

I'm completing one project per day to build practical Python experience. 
Each project focuses on learning something new.

## Projects

| # | Project | Concepts Learned |
|---|---------|------------------|
| 001 | [Expense Tracker](./001-expense-tracker) | Lists, dicts, loops, user input |
| 002 | Coming soon | ... |

## How to Run

Each project folder contains its own README with instructions.
```bash
cd 001-expense-tracker
python expense_tracker.py
```
